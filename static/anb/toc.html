                    any shrinkage, discoloration or distortion as a result of washing / dry cleaning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    any damage to curtains where the fabric had weakened due to age and usage. This is especially so for curtains exposed to spotlights, sunlight and chlorine fume, moisture and sea breeze.
                </li>
                <li>
                    curtains with blackout or plastic/latex coating, as some coating may blister, peel, self-stick or dissolve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    curtains made from lightweight, sheer fabric such as organza, silk, lace or day curtains. Such curtains are more affected by light exposure and have a shorter lifespan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    double-layered curtains which normally come with a lightweight fabric sewn together with a heavy fabric. The heavier fabric might pull/drag the lightweight fabric causing distortion or the lighter fabric to tear during the washing/dry cleaning process.
